        <h2 id='B1'>Stability</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The free proton (a proton not bound to nucleons or electrons) is a stable particle that has not been observed to break down spontaneously 
            to other particles. Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from 
            electrons, for which they have some affinity. Free protons exist in plasmas in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with electrons. 
            Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of cosmic rays, which propagate in vacuum for interstellar distances. Free protons are emitted directly 
            from atomic nuclei in some rare types of radioactive decay. Protons also result (along with electrons and antineutrinos) from the radioactive decay of free neutrons, which are unstable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spontaneous decay of free protons has never been observed, and protons are therefore considered stable particles according to the Standard Model. 
            However, some grand unified theories (GUTs) of particle physics predict that proton decay should take place with lifetimes between 1031 to 1036 years and 
            experimental searches have established lower bounds on the mean lifetime of a proton for various assumed decay products
        </p>
        <p>
            Experiments at the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan gave lower limits for proton mean lifetime of 6.6×1033 years for decay to an antimuon and a neutral pion, 
            and 8.2×1033 years for decay to a positron and a neutral pion.[24] Another experiment at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada searched for gamma rays resulting 
            from residual nuclei resulting from the decay of a proton from oxygen-16. This experiment was designed to detect decay to any product, and established a lower limit to 
            a proton lifetime of 2.1×1029 years.[25]
        </p>
        <p>
            However, protons are known to transform into neutrons through the process of electron capture (also called inverse beta decay). For free protons, this process 
            does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied. The equation is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>p<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> → n + ν<sub>e</sub></blockquote>
        <p>
            The process is reversible; neutrons can convert back to protons through beta decay, a common form of radioactive decay. In fact, a free neutron decays this way, 
            with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes.

        <h2 id='B2'>Quarks and the mass of a proton</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of the nuclear force, most of the mass of protons and neutrons is explained by special relativity. The mass of a proton 
            is about 80–100 times greater than the sum of the rest masses of the quarks that make it up, while the gluons have zero rest mass. The extra energy of the quarks and 
            gluons in a region within a proton, as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the QCD vacuum, accounts for almost 99% of the mass. The rest mass of a proton 
            is, thus, the invariant mass of the system of moving quarks and gluons that make up the particle, and, in such systems, even the energy of massless particles is still 
            measured as part of the rest mass of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up protons: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while constituent quark mass refers 
            to the current quark mass plus the mass of the gluon particle field surrounding the quark.[26]:285–286 [27]:150–151 These masses typically have very different values. As 
            noted, most of a proton's mass comes from the gluons that bind the current quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, 
            they possess energy—to be more specific, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE)—and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of protons (see mass in 
            special relativity). A proton has a mass of approximately 938 MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks contributes only about 9.4 MeV/c2; much of the 
            remainder can be attributed to the gluons' QCBE.
        </p>
        <p>
            The internal dynamics of protons are complicated, because they are determined by the quarks' exchanging gluons, and interacting with various vacuum condensates. Lattice QCD 
            provides a way of calculating the mass of a proton directly from the theory to any accuracy, in principle. The most recent calculations[31][32] claim that the mass is determined 
            to better than 4% accuracy, even to 1% accuracy (see Figure S5 in Dürr et al.[32]). These claims are still controversial, because the calculations cannot yet be done with quarks 
            as light as they are in the real world. This means that the predictions are found by a process of extrapolation, which can introduce systematic errors.[33] It is hard to tell whether 
            these errors are controlled properly, because the quantities that are compared to experiment are the masses of the hadrons, which are known in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
            These recent calculations are performed by massive supercomputers, and, as noted by Boffi and Pasquini: "a detailed description of the nucleon structure is still missing because 
            ... long-distance behavior requires a nonperturbative and/or numerical treatment..."[34] More conceptual approaches to the structure of protons are: the topological soliton 
            approach originally due to Tony Skyrme and the more accurate AdS/QCD approach that extends it to include a string theory of gluons,[35] various QCD-inspired models like the 
            bag model and the constituent quark model, which were popular in the 1980s, and the SVZ sum rules, which allow for rough approximate mass calculations.[36] These methods do not 
            have the same accuracy as the more brute-force lattice QCD methods, at least not yet.

        <h2 id='B3'>Charge radius</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The problem of defining a radius for an atomic nucleus (proton) is similar to the problem of atomic radius, in that neither atoms nor their nuclei have definite boundaries. 
            However, the nucleus can be modeled as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of electron scattering experiments: because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus, 
            the electrons "see" a range of cross-sections, for which a mean can be taken. The qualification of "rms" (for "root mean square") arises because it is the nuclear cross-section, 
            proportional to the square of the radius, which is determining for electron scattering
        </p>
        <p>
            The internationally accepted value of a proton's charge radius is 0.8768 fm (see orders of magnitude for comparison to other sizes). This value is based on measurements involving a 
            proton and an electron (namely, electron scattering measurements and complex calculation involving scattering cross section based on Rosenbluth equation for momentum-transfer 
            cross section), and studies of the atomic energy levels of hydrogen and deuterium.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in 2010 an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen (an exotic atom made of a proton and a 
            negatively charged muon). As a muon is 200 times heavier than an electron, its de Broglie wavelength is correspondingly shorter. This smaller atomic orbital is much more 
            sensitive to the proton's charge radius, so allows more precise measurement. Their measurement of the root-mean-square charge radius of a proton is "0.84184(67) fm, which 
            differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value of 0.8768(69) fm".[37] In January 2013, an updated value for the charge radius of a proton—0.84087(39) fm—was published. 
            The precision was improved by 1.7 times, increasing the significance of the discrepancy to 7σ.[6] The 2014 CODATA adjustment slightly reduced the recommended value for the proton 
            radius (computed using electron measurements only) to 0.8751(61) fm, but this leaves the discrepancy at 5.6σ.
        </p>
        <p>
            If no errors were found in the measurements or calculations, it would have been necessary to re-examine the world's most precise and best-tested fundamental theory: 
            quantum electrodynamics.[38] The proton radius was a puzzle as of 2017
        </p>
        <p>
            A resolution came in 2019, when two different studies, using different techniques involving the Lamb shift of the electron in hydrogen, and the corresponding one for 
            muonic protium, found the radius of the proton to be 0.833 fm, with an uncertainty of ±0.010 fm
        </p>
        <h4>Pressure inside the proton</h4>
        <p>Since the proton is composed of quarks confined by gluons, an equivalent pressure which acts on the quarks can be defined. This allows calculation of their distribution 
            as a function of distance from the centre using Compton scattering of high-energy electrons (DVCS, for deeply virtual Compton scattering). The pressure is maximum at the 
            centre, about 1035 Pa which is greater than the pressure inside a neutron star.[43] It is positive (repulsive) to a radial distance of about 0.6 fm, negative (attractive) 
            at greater distances, and very weak beyond about 2 fm</p>
        <h4>Charge radius in solvated proton, hydronium</h4>
        <p>The radius of the hydrated proton appears in the Born equation for calculating the hydration enthalpy of hydronium.</p>
        <h2 id='B4'>Interaction of free protons with ordinary matter</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Although protons have affinity for oppositely charged electrons, this is a relatively low-energy interaction and so free protons must lose sufficient velocity 
            (and kinetic energy) in order to become closely associated and bound to electrons. High energy protons, in traversing ordinary matter, lose energy by collisions with 
            atomic nuclei, and by ionization of atoms (removing electrons) until they are slowed sufficiently to be captured by the electron cloud in a normal atom.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in such an association with an electron, the character of the bound proton is not changed, and it remains a proton. The attraction of low-energy free protons to any 
            electrons present in normal matter (such as the electrons in normal atoms) causes free protons to stop and to form a new chemical bond with an atom. Such a bond happens at any 
            sufficiently "cold" temperature (that is, comparable to temperatures at the surface of the Sun) and with any type of atom. Thus, in interaction with any type of normal 
            (non-plasma) matter, low-velocity free protons do not remain free but are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come into contact, causing the proton 
            and molecule to combine. Such molecules are then said to be "protonated", and chemically they are simply compounds of hydrogen, often positively charged. Often, as a result, they 
            become so-called Brønsted acids. For example, a proton captured by a water molecule in water becomes hydronium, the aqueous cation H3O+.
