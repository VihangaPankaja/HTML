            A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol 
            p or p<sup>+</sup>
            , with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge and a mass slightly less than that of a neutron. 
            Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as "nucleons" (particles present in atomic nuclei).
        </p>
        <p>
            One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom; they are a necessary part of the nucleus. 
            The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number 
            (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number.

            The word proton is Greek for "first", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. 
            In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted 
            from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions.[3] Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a 
            building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.

            Although protons were originally considered fundamental or elementary particles, in the modern Standard Model of particle physics, 
            protons are classified as hadrons, like neutrons, the other nucleon. Protons are composite particles composed of three valence quarks: two up quarks of charge +
            2/3e and one down quark of charge −1/3
            e. The rest masses of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton's mass.[4] The remainder of a proton's mass is due to quantum 
            chromodynamics binding energy, which includes the kinetic energy of the quarks and the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together. 
            Because protons are not fundamental particles, they possess a measurable size; the root mean square charge radius of a proton is about 0.84–0.87 fm 
            (or 0.84×10−15 to 0.87×10−15 m).[5][6] In 2019, two different studies, using different techniques, have found the radius of the proton to be 0.833 fm, with an uncertainty of ±0.010 fm.

            Free protons occur occasionally on Earth: thunderstorms can produce protons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.[9][10] At sufficiently low temperatures 
            and kinetic energies, free protons will bind to electrons. However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. A fast proton 
            moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom. The result is a protonated atom, 
            which is a chemical compound of hydrogen. In vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a 
            neutral hydrogen atom, which is chemically a free radical. Such "free hydrogen atoms" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. 
            When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H2), which are the most common molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space.

            Free protons are routinely used for accelerators for proton therapy or various particle physics experiments, with the most powerful example being the Large Hadron Collider

            Protons are spin-1/2 
            fermions and are composed of three valence quarks,[11] making them baryons (a sub-type of hadrons). The two up quarks and one down quark of a proton are held 
            together by the strong force, mediated by gluons.[12]:21–22 A modern perspective has a proton composed of the valence quarks (up, up, down), the gluons, and transitory 
            pairs of sea quarks. Protons have a positive charge distribution which decays approximately exponentially, with a mean square radius of about 0.8 fm.[13]

            Protons and neutrons are both nucleons, which may be bound together by the nuclear force to form atomic nuclei. The nucleus of the most common isotope of the hydrogen atom 
            (with the chemical symbol "H") is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, 
            respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons.

            The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period. As early as 1815, William Prout proposed that all atoms 
            are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called "protyles"), based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of atomic weights (see Prout's hypothesis), which 
            was disproved when more accurate values were measured

            In 1886, Eugen Goldstein discovered canal rays (also known as anode rays) and showed that they were positively charged particles (ions) produced from gases. However, 
            since particles from different gases had different values of charge-to-mass ratio (e/m), they could not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative electrons 
            discovered by J. J. Thomson. Wilhelm Wien in 1898 identified the hydrogen ion as the particle with the highest charge-to-mass ratio in ionized gases.

            Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, Antonius van den Broek proposed that the place of each element in the periodic table 
            (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge. This was confirmed experimentally by Henry Moseley in 1913 using X-ray spectra.

            In 1917 (in experiments reported in 1919 and 1925), Rutherford proved that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery 
            of protons.[16] These experiments began after Rutherford had noticed that, when alpha particles were shot into air (mostly nitrogen), his scintillation detectors showed 
            the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as a product. After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air and found that when alpha particles 
            were introduced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. In 1919 Rutherford assumed that the alpha particle merely knocked a proton out of nitrogen, turning it 
            into carbon. After observing Blackett's cloud chamber images in 1925, Rutherford realized that the alpha particle was absorbed. After capture of the alpha particle, a 
            hydrogen nucleus is ejected, so that heavy oxygen, not carbon, is the end result i.e. Z is not decremented but incremented (see initial proposed reaction below). This was 
            the first reported nuclear reaction, 14N + α → 17O + p. Rutherford at first thought of our modern "p" in this equation as a hydrogen ion, H+.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on one's perspective, either 1919 (when it was seen experimentally as derived from another source than hydrogen) or 1920 (when it was recognized and proposed 
            as an elementary particle) may be regarded as the moment when the proton was 'discovered'.

            Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by Prout's hypothesis that hydrogen was the building block of all elements. Discovery 
            that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei as an elementary particle led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus H+ a special name as a particle, since he suspected 
            that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He named this new fundamental building block of the nucleus the proton, after the neuter singular of 
            the Greek word for "first", πρῶτον. However, Rutherford also had in mind the word protyle as used by Prout. Rutherford spoke at the British Association for the Advancement of 
            Science at its Cardiff meeting beginning 24 August 1920.[17] Rutherford first proposed (wrongly, see above) that this nitrogen reaction was 14N + α → 14C + α + H+. At the meeting, 
            he was asked by Oliver Lodge for a new name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom. He initially suggested both proton and prouton 
            (after Prout).[18] Rutherford later reported that the meeting had accepted his suggestion that the hydrogen nucleus be named the "proton", following Prout's word "protyle".[19] The 
            first use of the word "proton" in the scientific literature appeared in 1920.[20]
